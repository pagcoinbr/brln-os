## Basic Setup
**How to Setup Telegram Bot:**
1. Create a Telegram Bot:
Open the Telegram app and search for the "BotFather" bot.
Start a chat with BotFather and use the /newbot command to create a new bot.
Follow the instructions to set up your bot and obtain the API token.
2. Get Your Chat ID:
Start a chat with your newly created bot.
Visit the following URL in your web browser, replacing <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> with the actual token you obtained:
bash
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
Look for the "chat" object within the response. The "id" field in that object is your chat ID.
3. Get your TELEGRAM USER ID (This is very important to ensure you are the only user authorized to use the bot
Access https://t.me/userinfobot and this will return your TELEGRAM_USER_ID

**Repository Installation:**
1. Git Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools.git`

##

## [swap-wallet21.py](https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/swap-wallet21.py)
This is the best and cheapest tool ever for swaps out (from Lightning to On-chain)
Send SATS from your Lightning node directly to any Lightning Address. 
You can send it out to your strike lightning address and send it back to your node to your on-chain wallet with no FEES.

**Preparation**
1. Get the `config.ini` file https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/config.ini
2. You need to change the lines to your configuration. `nano config.ini`

        *[paths]*
        # set your paths in case you cron-job it: $ whereis lncli
        # replace pathtoumbrel for your full path for umbrel directory
        lncli_path = /pathtoumbrel/scripts/app compose lightning exec lnd lncli

        *[system]*
        # replace userpath for your full parent path to the .npm-global directory
        full_path_bos = /userpath/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/balanceofsatoshis/bos

3. SAVE `CTRL+O` and Exit `CTRL+X`

**How to Run**
1. You can run the code with the argument --local-balance <percentage>. Ex. `python3 swap-wallet21.py --local-balance 40`
This will first consider the channels where the local liquidity is above 40%
2. When you run the code, you should reply to some questions.

# [Disable and Close any Lightning Channel - Script](https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/closechannel.py)

This repository contains a Python script designed to disable a specific Lightning Network channel using `charge-lnd` before closing it. The script checks for pending HTLCs, ensures that the channel remains disabled, and uses dynamic fee rates to close the channel efficiently.

## Table of Contents

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Example Screenshot](#example-screenshot)
- [Running With Screen](#running-the-script-automatically-with-screen)

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **lncli** (part of LND)
- **charge-lnd** ([charge-lnd GitHub repository](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd))
- **LNDg** ([LNDg Github](https://github.com/cryptosharks131/lndg))
- **Requests library** (Python library for HTTP requests)

## Installation

### 1. **Install Python dependencies:**

Ensure you have requests installed:
```
pip install requests
```

### 2. **Install and configure charge-lnd:**

Follow the instructions on the official [charge-lnd GitHub](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd) repository to install and configure charge-lnd on your system.

## Usage

### 1. **Run the Script**

To run the script, execute the following command:

```
python3 closechannel.py
```

### 2. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**

* Enter the desired max_fee_rate: This is the maximum fee rate in sat/vbyte that you are willing to pay to close the channel.
* Enter the Channel ID: Provide the channel ID (chan_id) of the channel you wish to disable and close.**

### 3. **Watch the Script in Action**

### 4. **The script will:**

* Disable the channel by creating/updating a configuration file in the specified directory.
* Run charge-lnd to apply the configuration and disable the channel.
* Check for pending HTLCs and wait until they are cleared.
* Re-run charge-lnd periodically to ensure the channel remains disabled.
* Close the channel using the specified fee rate or a dynamic fee rate obtained from Mempool.Space.

### 5. **Monitor the Output**

* The script provides detailed output, showing each step of the process, including any errors encountered.

## Example Screenshot

## Running the Script Automatically with `screen`

To avoid manually monitoring the script in the terminal, you can run it in a `screen` session. This allows the script to continue running in the background, even if you disconnect from your session. You can also reattach to the session later to check on the progress.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. **Install `screen` (if not already installed)**

If `screen` is not already installed, you can install it using your package manager:

- **Debian/Ubuntu:**

```
  sudo apt-get install screen
```

### 2. **Start a new screen session**

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located:

``` 
cd /path/to/your-repository
```
Start a new screen session with a name of your choice:

```
screen -S <name_of_your_choice>
```

### 3. **Run the script inside the screen session**

Once inside the screen session, run your Python script:

```
python3 closechannel.py
```

### 4. **Detach from the screen session**

You can now detach from the screen session and leave the script running in the background:

* Detach from the session by pressing Ctrl + A, then D.

Your script will continue running even after you close the terminal.

### 5. **Reattach to the screen session later**

* If you want to check on the progress or logs of the running script, you can reattach to the screen session:

List all running screen sessions to find your session name:

```
screen -ls
```

Reattach to your session:

```
screen -r <your_session_name>
```

Now, you can see the output of your script and interact with it if necessary.

### 6. **Exit the screen session when done**

When your script has finished and you no longer need the session, you can exit the screen session by simply typing:

```
exit
```

This will close the session.


## üì¢ [Lightning Network Advertising Script with boskeysend.py](https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/boskeysend.py)

This Python script allows you to send low-cost advertisements via the **Lightning Network**. You can target nodes by country, limit the number of peers you want to send the message to, and filter out nodes with more than 150 channels. It's a simple and cost-effective way to spread your message to Lightning Network operators.

## Features

- **Target by country**: Use the ISO Alpha-2 country code (e.g., `br` for Brazil) to select which country's nodes you want to reach.
- **Limit the number of peers**: Define the maximum number of peers to send the message to.
- **Node filtering**: The script avoids nodes with more than 150 channels to focus on smaller operators.
- **Low cost**: Messages are sent via the Lightning Network with a default payment of just 1 satoshi.
- **Logging**: All operations are logged to a file (`boskeysend.log`), including successful and failed attempts.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to install the following:

1. **Python 3.6+**
2. **Python Libraries**:
    - `requests`: For fetching data from the API.

   You can install it using pip:

```
pip install requests
```

### How It Works?

The script performs the following tasks:

* Prompts for input: You will be asked to enter the country code (ISO Alpha-2), the message to send, and the maximum number of peers to send to.
* Fetches Lightning nodes: It queries the Mempool.space API to retrieve the list of Lightning nodes in the specified country.
* Filters nodes: The script only targets nodes with 150 channels or fewer.
* Sends the message: Using BOS, the script sends a 1-satoshi payment along with the message to each peer.
* Logs the results: All events, including errors, are logged in boskeysend.log.

### Usage

1. Run the script:

```
python3 boskeysend.py
```

2. Follow the prompts:

- Enter the country code (ISO Alpha-2 format).
- Enter the message you want to send.
- Enter the maximum number of peers to send the message to.

### Logging

All interactions are logged to boskeysend.log, including:

* The commands run with BOS
* The response code and output of each BOS command
* Errors encountered during the process
